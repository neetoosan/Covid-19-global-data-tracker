# Covid-19-global-data-tracker
covid 19 Global data tracker

### üß™ Project Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a global COVID-19 dataset. It includes data loading, cleaning, visualization, and insights generation using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

The goal is to:
- Understand trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare country-level performance.
- Visualize global case distribution using interactive maps.
- Extract meaningful insights from real-world pandemic data.

### üì• Dataset Source

This project uses an open-source dataset typically sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) or similar repositories. The dataset contains daily records of:

| Column              | Description                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| date              | Date of observation                  |
| location          | Country name                         |
| total_cases       | Cumulative confirmed cases           |
| new_cases         | Daily new cases                      |
| total_deaths      | Cumulative confirmed deaths          |
| new_deaths        | Daily new deaths                     |
| total_vaccinations| Cumulative number of vaccinations    |
| population        | Population of the country            |
| iso_code          | ISO 3-letter country code            |

> Note: You can replace covid_data.csv with any compatible CSV file containing these or similar columns.

### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
Optional (for saving figures):
pip install pillow  # For image handling
---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone or download the project directory.
2. Place your owid-covid-data.csv file in the root folder.
3. Run the analysis script:
  
   python analysis.py
   
4. Interactive visualizations will appear in your browser (for Plotly), and static plots will be shown inline or saved if configured.

---

### üìä Features

- Filters data for specific countries (Kenya, USA, India, Brazil, Germany).
- Computes derived metrics like death rate and vaccination coverage.
- Generates line charts for time-series trends.
- Displays bar charts comparing countries.
- Produces an optional choropleth world map showing total cases per country.

---

### üí° Key Insights Generated

At the end of the analysis, the script prints out:
- Fastest average vaccination rollout by country.
- Highest death rate observed.
- Country with the most confirmed cases.

---

### üì§ Exporting Results

You can modify the script to export visualizations as image files (e.g., PNG, PDF) or generate HTML reports using tools like Jupyter Notebook or plotly.offline.
